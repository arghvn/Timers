//We often want to execute Go code at some point in the future,
// or repeatedly at some interval. Go’s built-in timer and ticker features make both of these tasks easy.
// We’ll look first at timers and then at tickers.

	//Timers represent a single event in the future.
	// You tell the timer how long you want to wait, and it provides a
	// channel that will be notified at that time. 
	//This timer will wait 2 seconds.

    <-timer1.C

	//The <-timer1.C blocks on the timer’s channel C until it sends a value indicating that the timer fired.

	// One reason a timer may be useful is that you can cancel the timer before it fires. Here’s an example of that.

    go func() {

        <-timer2.C

		//Give the timer2 enough time to fire, if it ever was going to, to show it is in fact stopped.

// The first timer will fire ~2s after we start the program, but the second should be stopped .

//output :
//Timer 1 fired
//Timer 2 stopped
